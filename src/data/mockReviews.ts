The concierge service was outstanding - they helped me book impossible-to-get restaurant reservations. The spa was divine and the pool area was pristine. The only minor issue was that the elevator was a bit slow during peak hours.',

My main course - the "signature" lobster risotto - was completely bland and overcooked. The server was dismissive when we complained. The wine list was overpriced for mediocre selections.
